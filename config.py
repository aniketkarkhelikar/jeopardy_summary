2.1. Install NFS Client Packages

The clients need a different package to be able to connect to the server.
Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common

2.2. Create the Mount Point

Create a local directory on the client machine where the shared folder will be mounted. It's good practice to use the same path.
Bash

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share

2.3. Mount the Shared Directory

Now, mount the server's shared folder onto the local mount point you just created.
Bash

sudo mount 172.25.120.212:/mnt/nfs_share /mnt/nfs_share

Note: Replace 172.25.120.212 with your server's actual IP if it's different'''
